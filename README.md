TASK 1 :- Iris flower has species;setosa,versicolor,and virginica,which differs according to their measurements.Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train  a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify the.
TASK 2:- Unemploymentis measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force .We have seen a sharp increaseon the unemployment rate during Covid-19,so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
TASK 3:- The price of a car depends a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,features of the car,horsepower and the mileage it gives and manymore.Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning .So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
TASK 4:- WE have all been the recipient of spam emails before .Spam mail,or junk mail,is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time,frequently containing cryptic messages,scams,or most dangerously,phising content. In this project,use Python to build an email spam detector.Thenuse machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non - spam .Lets get started!
TASK 5 :- Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertize your product,the segment of people you advertize for,or the platform you are advertizing on about your product. Typically,a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product.So lets start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using python
